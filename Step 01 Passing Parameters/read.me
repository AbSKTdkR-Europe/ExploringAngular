This demo - simple as it is - shows a couple of important features of an AngularJS 2.0 (Alpha 36) program:
* It's written in TypeScript.
* The "application" consists of several (more precisely: two) components.
* Both components are implemented in a file of their own.
* The outer component's HTML code passes a parameter to the inner component.
* The HTLM code of the start page - the index.html - passes a parameter to the outer component. For some reason, this doesn't work at the time of writing (Sep 10, 2015).

In case you're puzzled by the name of the classes: I've extracted the demo from a chess app.
